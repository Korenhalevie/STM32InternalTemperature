# STM32InternalTemperature

A library and example to measure the **internal temperature** of STM32 microcontrollers using the **Arduino Framework**.

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to utilize the **internal temperature sensor** in STM32 microcontrollers. The code is written in C++ using an object-oriented approach and is designed to be compatible with the **Arduino Framework**. 

It reads the internal temperature sensor, calculates the temperature in both Celsius (°C) and Fahrenheit (°F), and outputs the results to the serial monitor.

## Features

- Reads the **internal temperature sensor** of STM32 microcontrollers.
- Converts and displays the temperature in **Celsius** and **Fahrenheit**.
- Object-Oriented Design for easy reuse and scalability.
- Compatible with the **Arduino IDE** and **Arduino Framework**.

## Compatibility

This code is designed for STM32 microcontrollers and has been tested with the **STM32F4 series** (e.g., STM32F401CCU6). It should work with most STM32 devices that include an internal temperature sensor.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **STM32 microcontroller** (e.g., STM32F401, STM32F103, etc.).
- **Arduino IDE** or a compatible environment (e.g., PlatformIO).
- **STM32duino** library installed in the Arduino IDE.
- An **STLink programmer** for uploading and debugging.

### Configuration for STLink and Serial Output

If you are using **PlatformIO**, add the following configuration to your `platformio.ini` file to enable uploading via STLink and Serial communication:

```ini
upload_protocol = stlink
build_flags = -D PIO_FRAMEWORK_ARDUINO_ENABLE_CDC
